# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do Not Use Replit

This makes it easy for malicious actors to steal your bot token and compromise your bot.

- Performance Issues:
Replit is not designed for long-running processes like Discord bots. Your bot may frequently disconnect or crash.

- Free-tier Replit projects sleep after inactivity, causing your bot to go offline.

### Lack of Control:

- Replit provides limited control over the environment, making it difficult to manage dependencies or debug issues.
